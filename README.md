Wordpress theme for Termnature
==============================

This is a child theme for [Termnature](https://www.termnature.com) based on [Beans Framework](http://www.getbeans.io/). The only thing we need to do here is to preprocess the LESS files into a CSS file. We can then upload all the PHP and the CSS files in the child theme folder into our WP server.

Running `npm start` will compile the LESS file into a `style.css` file inside the `tm-beans-child` folder.
